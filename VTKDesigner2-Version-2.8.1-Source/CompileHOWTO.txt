VTK Designer 2 from VCreate Logic

Starting with VTK Designer version 2.5, the source code structure of VTK Designer has changed.
This is because, previously GCF was a project that was developed within VTK Designer; but now
it is an independent project in itself. Non-VTK Designer specific components (like PropertyEditor, 
ScriptEditor etc) are now an integral part of GCF. The VTK Designer code base has hence been 
considerably changed to make use of the new GCF structure.

    NOTE: PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOUR TEXT EDITOR'S TAB SIZE IS 4 SPACES. THE CODE WOULD LOOK
    HORRIBLE OTHERWISE. I JUST DID NOT FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO PUT THIS NOTE ;-)

To compile VTK Designer 2.5.x, you will need to do the following

*) Ensure that you have 4.4.x, and VTK 5.0.3+ compiled and installed on your computer.

a) Checkout a copy of VTK Designer 2 from the following SVN location
https://svn2.hosted-projects.com/vcreatelogic/VTKDesigner2 into a directory say
~/vtkdesigner2 on your computer. You must be able to find the following
files now.
    - ~/vtkdesigner2/License.txt
    - ~/vtkdesigner2/CompileHOWTO.txt
When you checkout VTKDesigner2, a copy of GCF is also automatically checked out.

b) Create a directory called VTK5 at the same level as GCF, ie 
~/vtkdesigner2/VTK5. In this directory ensure that there are three
sub-directories. 
    - ~/vtkdesigner2/VTK5/bin - Contains all .so/.dll files
    - ~/vtkdesigner2/VTK5/include - Contains all vtk*.h files
    - ~/vtkdesigner2/VTK5/lib - Contains all *.so/*.lib files
On GNU/Linux you can create bin and lib as soft-links to the directory that 
contains all *.so files.

c) Run the following command 
(On Windows assuming that you have checkout GCF and VTK Designer into C:\VTKDesigner2)
    cd C:\VTKDesigner2
    qmake -tp vc -recursive "GCF_BASE=C:/VTKDesigner2/GCF" "PROJECT_BASE=C:/VTKDesigner2"
    Launch Visual Studio and Build All. 
    
(On Linux)
    cd ~/vtkdesigner2
    qmake -recursive "GCF_BASE=~/vtkdesigner2/GCF" "PROJECT_BASE=~/vtkdesigner2"
    make
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$~/vtkdesigner2/bin:LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ./bin/VTKDesigner2
