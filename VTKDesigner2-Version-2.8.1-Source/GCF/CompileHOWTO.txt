Generic Component Framework from VCreate Logic

Environment Settings
--------------------

GCF version 2.3 and later comes with a built-in plugin for Qt Creator that
helps developers to use Qt Creator for building GCF applications. This makes
development of GCF applications on Qt Creator simple, easy, fast and 
super-productive. 

For this to happen you will need to compile Qt Creator from its sources. 
At present we support Qt Creator version 1.3.0 and 1.3.1. We hope that 
the plugin will continue to work for future versions of Qt Creator as well.

Create the following environment variables if you want to compile GCF for
Qt Creator.

- GCF_DIR :- Complete path to the GCF source code
- QTC_SOURCE :- Complete path to Qt Creator source code
- QTC_BUILD :- Complete path to Qt Creator build directory
- QTDIR :- Complete path to the version of Qt against which GCF is built.


How To Compile
--------------------

To compile GCF you will need to check out a copy of the code and then 
execute the following command in the directory where you can see include 
and source as child directories

On Linux - 
- cd ~/GCF
- qmake -Wnone -recursive "GCF_BASE=`pwd`"
- make

On Windows (with Visual Studio 2005) - 
- cd C:\GCF
- qmake -Wnone -tp vc -recursive "GCF_BASE=%cd%"
- Open VS 2005 and Build All

On Windows (with MinGW)
- cd C:\GCF
- qmake -Wnone -recursive "GCF_BASE=%cd%" "GCF_DISABLE_ACTIVEX=1"
- mingw32-make

Essentially GCF_BASE should be the complete path of the directory where 
the code is available
