/**
\ingroup gcfcomponents
\defgroup utilscomponent Utils Component
\brief This component provides utility functions for use in your application.

The idea behind utils component is to provide simple and easy to use utility functions that may not be 
currently available in Qt. <i>We could have provided these utility functions as a library. However we 
chose to offer them via a component - because GCF is a component framework ;-)</i>

To use the Utils component, you will simply have to include the following line in your 
\ref componentarch_applicationxml "Application XML" file.

\code
<Component Name="UtilsComponent" Library="UtilsComponent" />
\endcode

Once the Utils component is loaded in your application, you can search for any of the interfaces 
offered by this component using the \ref GCF::findObject() method. For example, to look for the 
\ref IFileSystemUtils interface; you can

\code
#include <GCF/Utils/IFileSystemUtils>

IFileSystemUtils* fsUtils = GCF::findObject<IFileSystemUtils*>();
if(fsUtils)
{
	// use the interface here..
}
\endcode
*/
