/**
\fn virtual QString IFileSystemUtils::findFileInPath(const QString& fileName) = 0;

This function looks for \c fileName in the application directory followed by each and every directory
in PATH environment variable. It returns a complete path of the file where it was first found. If the 
file was not found, then a NULL string is returned.

- On Windows the search order is 
	- application directory (\c QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath())
	- current working directory (\c QDir::currentDirPath())
	- each and every directory in the PATH environment variable
	
- On Linux the search order is 
	- application directory (\c QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath())
	- current working directory (\c QDir::currentDirPath())
	- each and every directory in the PATH environment variable
	- each and every directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
	
\note This function is faster than calling findFilesInPath(...).first().

/**
\fn virtual QStringList IFileSystemUtils::findFilesInPath(const QString& fileName) = 0;

This function returns a list of complete-paths where the given \c fileName is found on the system. If the file was 
not found anywhere; then an empty list is returned.

- On Windows the search order is 
	- application directory (\c QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath())
	- current working directory (\c QDir::currentDirPath())
	- each and every directory in the PATH environment variable
	
- On Linux the search order is 
	- application directory (\c QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath())
	- current working directory (\c QDir::currentDirPath())
	- each and every directory in the PATH environment variable
	- each and every directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

/**
\fn virtual void IFileSystemUtils::deleteDirectory(const QString& dir, bool deleteDir=false) = 0;

This function recursively deletes the contents of directory whose name/path is specified by \c dir. If
\c deleteDir is true, then the directory is also removed at the end.
