QtDotNet Style v2.3

QtDotNet Style provides an alternative GUI look for Qt
applications on Windows.

The GUI look is very similar to the style introduced in Visual
Studio 2005, Office 2003 as well as in .NET Windows Forms (when
the RenderMode is set to "Professional" instead of "System"). It
gives applications a modern gradient appearance for tool bars and
menus while retaining the native look and feel for other widgets.
