    	\section1 Description
	
            QtDotNet Style provides an alternative GUI look for Qt applications on Windows.
	

	
            The GUI look is very similar to the style introduced in
            Visual Studio 2005, Office 2003 as well as in .NET Windows
            Forms (when the RenderMode is set to "Professional"
            instead of "System"). It gives applications a modern
            gradient appearance for tool bars and menus while
            retaining the native look and feel for other widgets.
